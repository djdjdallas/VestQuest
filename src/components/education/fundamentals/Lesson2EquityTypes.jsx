              Double-Trigger Acceleration

              Some equity grants include provisions for "acceleration" â€“ when vesting speeds up due to certain events. 
              <strong> Double-trigger acceleration</strong> means your equity vests faster if two events occur: 
              typically (1) the company is acquired AND (2) you're terminated within a certain timeframe (often 12 months).

              Post-Termination Exercise Windows

            <p>
              For stock options, you typically have a limited time to exercise after leaving the company (usually 90 days). 
              Some companies offer extended post-termination exercise windows (1-10 years). This can be a valuable benefit, 
              as it gives you more time to decide whether to exercise and pay for your options.

            <p>
              For private companies, even if your equity has theoretical value, you may not be able to sell it until a 
              "liquidity event" (IPO, acquisition). Some companies allow for "secondary sales" where employees can sell 
              shares to investors before an IPO, but this is not guaranteed.

              <strong>Stock options</strong> (ISOs/NSOs) require you to purchase shares by exercising, while <strong>RSUs</strong> convert directly to shares upon vesting without requiring purchase.

            <p>
              <strong>ISOs</strong> offer the best tax treatment if you meet holding requirements, but have complex rules and potential AMT implications.

            </div>
            <p>
              <strong>RSUs</strong> are simpler and always have value if the company has value, but offer less upside potential and less favorable tax treatment than options.

              The type of equity you're offered often correlates with company stage â€“ early-stage startups offer options, while later-stage and public companies typically offer RSUs.
