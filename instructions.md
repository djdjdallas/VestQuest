# Setting Up Jest with Next.js

Due to the permissions issues and complex dependencies, here is a list of commands you should run to properly set up testing for your project.

First, fix any npm permissions issues:

```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/lib/node_modules
```

Then install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react babel-jest jest
```

For now, you can focus on the simplified tests:

```bash
npm run test:simple
npm test
```

These will test the core utility functions without needing to handle React components.

To properly test React components in the future, you'd need to:

1. Set up babel-jest with proper React support
2. Create a test setup file that mocks all required dependencies
3. Set up the necessary mocks for Next.js features

For now, you can validate the testing strategy works by using the simple tests to verify that your core utility functions are working correctly.

## Key Testing Files

- `/simple-tests/` - Basic tests that don't require complex transformations
- `/src/__tests__/utils-only.test.js` - Tests utility functions directly
- `/src/__tests__/utils/calculations.test.js` - More comprehensive tests for calculations

## Known Issues

The JSX parsing error happens because:

1. Next.js projects need special configuration to run Jest tests on React components
2. The Next.js Babel configuration is not being properly applied in the Jest environment
3. You need to install and configure @babel/preset-react

For comprehensive component testing, it would be best to use the Next.js built-in testing support by installing the following:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom jest-environment-jsdom
```

And then utilizing the Next.js testing configuration.
