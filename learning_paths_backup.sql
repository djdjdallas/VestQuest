At private companies, double-trigger RSUs typically vest upon both time completion and a liquidity event, aligning vesting with the ability to sell shares.', 'For IPO scenarios, companies typically implement a "net settlement" process where they withhold a portion of vesting shares (often at supplemental wage withholding rates of 22-37% federal plus state taxes) to cover estimated tax obligations. This withholding may not cover your full tax liability if you''re in a higher tax bracket. After vesting, additional gains or losses are treated as capital gains/losses when you sell the shares. Some companies offer special programs around IPOs to help employees cover tax obligations during lock-up periods, such as secondary sales, cash advances, or loans. Planning for RSU vesting events should include setting aside additional cash for taxes beyond the standard withholding and understanding your company''s specific policies around withholding and liquidity.', '{RSU,"Tax Withholding","Net Settlement","Lock-up Period","Ordinary Income","Supplemental Wage Rate"}', '2025-05-07 02:30:44.855843+00', '2025-05-07 02:30:44.855843+00'),

Founder equity usually starts fully-owned with reverse vesting applied for investor protection, while employee equity starts unvested and must be earned over time. Founders typically have voting rights and possibly board seats, while employees usually have no governance role.', 'The tax treatment also differs significantly. Founders can file an 83(b) election on their reverse-vesting shares at formation when the value is minimal, starting their capital gains holding period immediately. Employees face higher tax implications as the company valuation increases. Founder equity is also more likely to have special rights like acceleration upon termination without cause or acquisition, and may include alternative equity classes or super-voting rights. While founders typically face more significant dilution over the company''s lifetime, they also start with much larger equity percentages. During down rounds or difficult periods, founder equity is sometimes subject to re-vesting or restructuring to retain founder engagement.', '{"Founder Equity","Common Stock","Reverse Vesting","83(b) Election","Voting Rights","Board Representation"}', '2025-05-07 02:30:44.855843+00', '2025-05-07 02:30:44.855843+00');
